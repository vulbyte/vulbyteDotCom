		<p>
			hello! i'm vulbyte and this is my ranking of games! <br>
			i just wanted to add a little micro blerb about how this works before you read, because <em>my ranking is
				not-conventional.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			so here's how it works, is this graph is 2d, the higher on the list it is the better of a game i think it is
			overall.
			<br>
			then the ranking i give a game out of 10 is how well i think the game aligns with the perceived vision and overall
			fun of the game.
			<br>
			so as an example, a 6/10 game which is boring but is genuinely revolutionary might be very very high on the list,
			while a 9/10 game which is really fun might [very unlikely] be below it.
			<br>
			please also not the graphics meet a similar bar, so as an example a low poly game that flawlessly executes the
			poly poly style they're going for will have a better graphics rating when a realistic game where there's a very
			visible texture seam on the guns you hold
			<br>
			this is all obviously arbitrary so don't read into it too much :3

							review: `ultrakill is an amazing arena-shooter, the gameplay is by far the best being most similar to doom 2016 but with a much better feel and weapons
                can actually combo each other instead of simply compliment.<br>
                it uses graphics best described as "late ps1" but with some modern improves. although seen as a downside
                it helps the game run at consistent stable framerates. <br>
                the music is largely solid, each stage feeling like it fits each level without ever crossing the line
                into
                distracting or bad. the only thing i would argue is that i feel as if the music can feel a bit flat, and
                more more variety with each song could help a lot`

subnautica is a fantastic game that is truely unique, each area feels expansive and unique with plenty of sprawling environments to explore. the creative way they used a volcanic pillar to justify the 2km³ map feel much more real and justified. as well as the great biodiversity and great sense of exploration, only complaints are that grinding for materials can be a bit tedious, some audio bugs, some ai just going through walls, and some other stuff i'm sure i'm forgetting. overall the game is very fun and i personally consider it a must play`,

the game is fun as a "first vr game", but is better off in short bursts. the game has some questionable color grading making it so when you take a hit it turns the flashlight from a "sorta needed" into a "dear god i can't see anything".
some easy patches would easily raise this game by a while point.
please don't play on harder difficulties.

				playing against bots is funner, but the bots can be far too repetitive.`
