now, i didn't know where to fit this in nicely, but i want to state it publicly because i wanna make my line clear, especally after certain controversies online [display twitter almand screenshots].

- i will not tolerate hate or discrimination towards: sexuality, gender, race, religion, country of origin, or anything like that. 
    * but gays are- i don't care. if you don't like it or get it so be it, this isn't the place for that.
    * but with gender what about-, no i'm going to cut you off there. you're entitled to your opinions, however this is not something i will debait here. this is isn't something to debait here. what i'll say is this, if someone has a name, and they change their last name for whatever reason, are you going to with a straight face refuse to refer to them by that name?i'll leave it there.
    * but people who are- it doesn't matter, simply but it's inhumane, just like many other garbage things on this list.
    * but these people are against god!- that doesn't matter. what you need to understand is religion limits you, not others. and i will not allow religeon to be used as a shitty excuse against others. as the bible says [jesus is confused where the bible said to hate trans ppl].
    * but this country has- yeh, the country not the person. you can hate the people and the politicians and everyone responsible for those actions. but you're going to tell me some farmer in a rural area is at all responsible for that stuff? common.

if you don't think you can handle this, that's fine, get out of here. i don't want you in this community.

sorry for the serious tone, i didn't generally like that tone, but i feel like it's something worth sharing.
