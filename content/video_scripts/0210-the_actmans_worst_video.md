# the act mans worst video

okay, you read the title, let's just get right into it.

## intro | context and history

this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRUgM-RGeA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRUgM-RGeA), is honestly the worst video i have watched in recent memory.

for those of you who are unaware the "actman" is a creator who i started watching about... *jesus...* 5 years ago.

their main series is something called the "why so." series, a series which in involves the actman generally discribing the events of the game, then discussing some mechanics or alternative modes, leaving with pseudo steam review of good, bad, or mid.

they have a generally "[dude bro](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/dudebro/)" character who they play as during their videos and their videos are generally a great "[normie](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/normie)" way, in the way they generally don't go very deep into mechanics or feedback, and keep the reviews very surface level.

this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRUgM-RGeA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRUgM-RGeA), is not that.

i want my statement that you take away from this entire video to be this: 
"this is not a video anyone should watch, it does not research any arguments, and incredibly emotional and reactive, while missing massive cuts of context or reasoning."

## disclaimers

before i get into the meat i want to quickly disclose my biasts towards the 3 main parties so you understand my perspective from this point forward:
- "the actman", as mentioned i've watched him for about 5 years and generally enjoy his content... **generally**. they're easily the one i'm most familiar with of the 3.
- thor from "pirate software", friend of mine bubbshalub introduced me to them, and i binged a bit of their content when unity decided to fuck over game devs. i know a bit of their history but not much outside that.
i actually personally have a bit of a recent distaste of them due to platforming [asmondgold](https://www.youtube.com/@AsmonTV) after the comments about: [anti-trans comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frMCUe5D3Pg) and [comments about women and children from palestine deserving to die because they from an "inferior culture"](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/asmongold-suspended-from-twitch-following-racist-tirade-about-palestinians/), a
- lastly, ross aka "accursed_farms", i know nothing of them outside of the "stop killing games" movement they started and a breif recap pyrocynical did on their critical knockoff channel.

so with the out of the i don't want any of you to come at me as an "actman hater", i was in on his videos before the quantumTV arc, you all can sit down.

oh, and if i leave something out, it does not mean i am trying to bury the point or part of the video, i just simply feel it isn't relevant or i don't have much to say on it.

## the problems in question

i want to restate this for emphasis, this is the worst video they have made, and in my opinion they should take it down.

the video at the time of recording is titled "[Why Won't He Stop Killing Games?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRUgM-RGeA)", and there are 3 primary issues with the video:

1. the video does not clearly explain the movement
2. the movement does not clearly explain pirate softwares perspective
3. the video is actively agressive and has several points that have no point outside of making pirate software look bad.
4. dispite the name of the chapters, they don't actually properly explain anything and just expect you to take eveything at face value.
5. they don't actually have any empathy for the other party (before anyone gets upset, eat the rich).

*as a viewer you should be offended by this video.*

and before you get all in arms and say i'm white knighting pirate software, let me remind you **i am more of a fan of the actman then pirate software**.

however, i am a person who is getting a CS degreee and i am actively working on becoming a developer and *cough cough* i go development streams almost every weekend. *cough cough*, so i have a little more empathy towards devs then the average gamer might.

dispite that **i am in support of the idea, however not this execution**.

okay, so, let's get to the points.

### issue 1: the video does not explain the movement.
Throughout the 26minute video, the video does not once properly explain what the "stop killing games movement" actually is, the most they do is insert *glances* of what the movement actually is, but don't actually formally explain it at all, expecting you to figure it out from context. 

so let me give it to you: 
>"Stop Killing Games" is a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers. An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods - with no stated expiration date - but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends. This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible. Furthermore, the legality of this practice is largely untested in many countries. 

so let's break down SEVERAL issues this statement has.
### > "the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers"

okay, first issue, when game servers are shut down they're not actively destroying games. Because a server is shut down it's not destoryed, it's end of lifed. this is a massive difference because in most instances these old games can still be modded and the like. and it doesn't matter if the game is online or not if it's not maintained, ie:

a great counter example is:  "[black ops 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III/)",
the game was released in 2015, is no longer getting updates. online play is completely taken over by hackers and script kitties who exploit the game. me and bubbshalub tried to play it about a year ago and it was literally unplayable due to the hacking issue.
so even if a games servers are online or not, it means nothing if the game isn't maintained, either by the developer or the player-base the it doesn't matter if the servers are up or not.

it is a valid arguement that you can play this game where as others like the crew you can't, however i want to bring this up as: **lacking online play doesn't mean the game is destoryed.**

***if*** a publisher retroactively disables a game so it is no longer playable, i personally think that there should be some recourse such as a class action or a refund, however no longer running the servers is not "destorying games".

#### > "the legality of publishers destroying video games they have **sold** to customers"

wait, didn't you just read that one?, yes, but i want to hone into another part. a massive part.

> "games they have **sold** to customers"
okay, so what about free to play games such as apex legends and league?

ohohoh, but they have a faq page where they acknowledge this!
>"A: While free-to-play games are free for users to try, they are supported by microtransactions, which customers spend money on. When a publisher ends a free-to-play game without providing any recourse to the players, they are effectively robbing those that bought features for the game. Hence, they should be accountable to making the game playable in some fashion once support ends. Our proposed regulations would have no impact on non-commercial games that are 100% free, however."

okay, i don't wanna dive to hard into this, so imma just hammer out a few quick points:
1. if you buy bits for say a twitch stream, if the streamer is no longer live are you entitled to a refund? a software a lot of streamers used called [stream avatars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/665300/Stream_Avatars/) can allow users to engauge in onstream fights with other characters. if a streamer stops streaming is this complient to the same lays since it is effectively a game?
2. what about ip law? using fornite and cod as another example, there's many many forms of ip licencing, such as [cod featuring bevis and butthead](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-adds-beavis-and-butt-head-and-cel-shaded-maps/2900-6709/). by this arguement you're intitled to these skins post service, which is likely against the contract said studio has with said ip.
3. by a similar logic, what if you went to a concert that was free for the public, but you could say buy a backstage pass? if you bought a backstage pass to a concert, you are then entitled to your backstage access at anytime. 

> This practice is a form of planned obsolescence
no it isn't. planned obsolescence is when a manufacturer plans for something to fail after a certain amount of time. an example of this would be making a game where after 1 year the game overwrites core files making the game unplayable.
**not including offline play is not planned obsolescence, it's most likely a dev to who couldn't implement the feature due to management**. just like how [halo infinate has local co-op](https://www.makeuseof.com/halo-infinite-how-to-play-split-screen-co-op/) in the game but [management won't let devs finish the feature](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/microsoft-breaks-pledge-cancels-split-screen-halo-infinite-multiplayer/).

to be clear, microsoft PROMISED local campeign co-op, and anyone who bought the game with that promise should be eligible for a refund, however this is a management decision, not a "game having planned obsolescence", and most things lacking offline play should be seen as this, as offline requires a lot more effort then building something stand alone.

i don't want to dog on this anymore, but i wanted to show you how with literally the first paragraph on [stopkillinggames.com](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) is presented, it leaves MANY issues with how the initiative is targeted.


### issue 2: the movement does not clearly explain pirate softwares perspective

now i'm now saying when you make a video on something you have to break down evrything to reach a neutral understanding or whatever, one of the best videos in this reguard was actually with [steve mould](https://www.youtube.com/stevemould) and [mehdi of electroboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx2LEqTQT4E), where they were arguing the "chain fountain" effect, i believe now called the "mould effect".

the long story short is they had a breif basically one to two sentances explaining moulds point of view before trying to "debunk it". as you can [see here](https://youtu.be/hx2LEqTQT4E?si=b-ywc6UYwqDXUJWk&t=200) (timestamped) electroboom disagrees while also still playing into the jokey manner that world class entertainers like mehdi do. 

and before you sauce me about "electroboom isn't a real entertainer", the dude has the time over 8million subscribers, and of his last like 30 videos, his lowest viewcount is like 700k, and his recent from the same sample reaching almost 5million views. [**that is almost double the average NHL game in 2025**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/305801/average-tv-viewership-nhl-stanley-cup-games/), i don't wanna hear no mehdi hate!

anyways, getting back on track, pirate softwares point was breifly skimmed over with it being represented as "that's dogshit, eat my entire ass".

i remember watching clips of it but i can't find the clip due to numerous 12 hour streams with similar thumbnails that i honestly don't have the time to go through and find the exact clip because i don't have the time to do so.
however, i think we should steelman as opposed to strawman as that is how you can properly debait, and actually attempt to empathise and understand ones arguement, so let's do that.

with the initial statement the actman used [here](https://youtu.be/voRUgM-RGeA?si=jgkKzzx5ZxpiuGi_&t=332), thor says and i quote 

"
are you against that this is, not only do I not want to back this I'm going to actively tell people not to.
"

now the issue with this is that originally this was an off the cuff statement said on stream live. while also not actually giving the context of what was said. however i have a few aggressive issues with this section of the video.

#### first: the act man has in my opinion at this point failed to properly explain the movement, 
they only explaining it as: ["...its entire goal is game preservation ..."](https://youtu.be/voRUgM-RGeA?si=VxvNQh3yImH8faen&t=62)
and incase you think i'm being hyperbolic, no they literally say immediately after:["stop killing games is as simple as those 4 words"](https://youtu.be/voRUgM-RGeA?si=CeIvH_zd0iEoO1Ee&t=70)

then let acrid farm follow up with a slightly more verbose way to say the same thing, effectively it's the same thing as the first paragraph on their webpage:
["as a refresher stop Killing Games is a consumer movement to stop publishers from effectively destroying video games they have already sold to customers"](https://youtu.be/voRUgM-RGeA?si=FgsB05i05XZFRTXQ&t=73)

i kid you not this is the ENTIRE premise we're given at the start of the video. it's so vague that you would at face value HAVE to agree with it.

it's a similar slimey tactic people use to justify the lack of privacy and rights. where you have companies saying "you can't repair your car because you might be a victim of SA". And before you think i'm making this up or i'm pewdiepie rn, 
[here's a clip from louis rossman sharing a video where a lobby group called "the colaition for safe and secure data" released a video that directly implys that you would be SA'd in a parking lot if this law passes.](https://youtu.be/hieoUkUiFbg?si=bwY76ygkipp2lDud&t=309)
you can actually see someone on facebook (don't worry this is 2020 so it likely isn't a bot thankfully) said this video made them scared of parking garages.
and incase you want to this this is a civilian initiative or something with people who are actually concerned, if we [use the wayback machine to visit the site since the website is now taken down](https://web.archive.org/web/20200812210233/https://safeandsecuredata.org/), we can see that this group was formally called the "alliance of automobile manufacturers", 
HUH, THAT SOUNDS FISHY DON'T IT???

if we take a quick jump to the wiki page:
["The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI) is a Washington, D.C.–based trade association and lobby group whose members include international car and light duty truck manufacturers that build and sell products in the United States."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Automotive_Innovation)
if you scoll just a touch further you will then see in the memebers section such individuals as:
- BMW,
- ferrari
- ford
- honda
- hyundai
- kia
- Lucky Goldstar [lg]
- McLaren
- AND VOLKSWAGON, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF LYING TO CONUSMERS [*cough* diesel gate *cough shit cough*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal)

[**the reason i point this out is because the actman follows up thors deposition comparing it to something like a "stop clubbing seals" movement**](https://youtu.be/voRUgM-RGeA?si=qjAnC3PdV_fob2CK&t=325).
this is a disgusting manipulative tactic and is not something one should be proud of. it's an underhanded tactic and only exist to make your opponent look worse.

just because you are passionate about games and the idea does not mean you should slander your opponenet with such a negative association.

so let's actually see what pirate had to say, using his videos [stop killing games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioqSvLqB46Y) and [stop killing games - 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3jMKeg9S-s), so that way we can properly understand his points and his opinions.

they point out the following issues, which i conveniently cut down for you:
- ["
if we're trying to kill off the practice of developers putting together a live service game pitching it as a single player experience and then taking away support in the future this ain't it
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=hTXzTCDyMp3C5B9r&t=75)
and later expands on it by reading the following:
["
specifically the initiative seeks to prevent the remote disabling of video games by the Publishers before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=lnMozicciWCP8U-8&t=105)
then
[" 
isn't always possible in all video games and it doesn't call out the specific practice that this is supposedly trying to defeat it is incredibly vague and will damage all live service games 
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=9MjceMtdDtQtB5en&t=116)
and expands on it with:
["
 how would you keep League of Legends in a functional playable State you'd have to rearchitecturing a billion damage you don't trust the client you trust the server the client just displays what it's told right so if we wanted to re architect this we'd have to take all of that server logic push it back out into the client and somehow make that playable in a multiplayer only video game that doesn't make sense to me.
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=8raYRyzc-TbN-BKA&t=127)
then thor points out:
["
so this isn't going to work for all games why is it calling out all games
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=tzxcpO2XpggyMGXu&t=166)

and it makes COMPLETE SENSE, now here's where being late and not emotional comes in handy, [gamers nexus interviewed ross on their comsumer advocasy channel, where they said and i quote:
"
okay if you want you here's the software but it's going to require a Graviton 3 processor if you want to run this good luck figuring it out you're on your own 
"
](https://youtu.be/p9ahH6HrtTc?si=lpOkMGV6uS39wekF&t=1166), 

and not this is a critical point, many people are upset at pirate software because "he's misrepresenting the whole thing!", but... he's not...

the gamers nexus video came out june 27th 2025, when thors video released on: Aug 6, 2024, roughly 10 months before the gamers nexus interview.

the home page of [stopkillinggames.com/](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) mentions nothing about server stuff
if we then jump to the FAQ page there's only 2 result for the word "server":
the first being a FAQ that reads:
[
Q: isn't it impractical, if not impossible to make online-only multiplayer games work without company servers?
A: Not at all. The majority of online multiplayer games in the past functioned without any company servers and were conducted by the customers privately hosting servers themselves and connecting to each other. Games that were designed this way are all still playable today. As to the practicality, this can vary significantly. If a company has designed a game with no thought given towards the possibility of letting users run the game without their support, then yes, this can be a challenging goal to transition to. If a game has been designed with that as an eventual requirement, then this process can be trivial and relatively simple to implement. Another way to look at this is it could be problematic for some games of today, but there is no reason it needs to be for games of the future.
](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq)

and i want to hone in on specific point:
"Games that were designed this way are all still playable today."
yes, games that are made this way can run because they're made that way. there are many instances where that isn't the case. and yes they concede with:

> "If a company has designed a game with no thought given towards the possibility of letting users run the game without their support, then yes, this can be a challenging goal to transition to."

and guess what, most companies *do not do this*, how many times has adobe given users issue for trying to run offline, how many times have users been shot in the foot with a game not being able to be activated without an online connection?

i'm not saying this is good, what i'm saying is it's incredibly burdensome and does in many cases require rearchitecting the game.

then the other argument that mentions servers is:
[
Q: what about large-scale MMORPGs? Isn't it impossible for customers to run those when servers are shut down?
A: Not at all. However, limitations can apply. Several MMORPGs that have been shut down have seen 'server emulators' emerge that are capable of hosting thousands of other players, just on a single user's system. Not all will be this scalable, however. For extra demanding videogames that require powerful servers the average user will not have access to, the game will not be playable on the same scale as when the developer or publisher was hosting it. That said, that is no excuse for players to not be able to continue playing the game in some form once support ends. So, if a server could originally support 5000 people, but the end user version can only support 500, that's still a massive improvement from no one being able to play the game ever again.
](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq)

so now if we look over these 2 quotes, we do not have a clear statement similar to: "if you want you here's the software but it's going to require a Graviton 3 processor if you want to run this good luck figuring it out you're on your own".

they don't talk about ANY technical details, so a developer which pirate software is, who is intimately familiar with the space is going to immediately have issues with the statement.

i take it if you're watching this video you're a gamer right? if i were to make a statement like: "every video game just has a white guy as the protagonist" your mind is immediate racing with:

*into chords to happy starts playing*

- coach & rochelle |left 4 dead 2
- bangalore | apex
- roland | borderlands 1/2
- nomali |  relooted

- Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima | yakuza
- Ryo Hazuki | Shenmue I & II
- chun li and ryu | street fighter
- carl johnson | gta

- mae nightmare eyes | NITW
- ENA | dream bbq 
- bread | i am bread 
- v1 | ultrakill (canonical woman)

**to be very clear i'm not turing this into a diversity thing**, i'm simply saying if you are a "true gamer", your mind likely did something similar to the above, immediately thinking of exceptions ot what i say, and might be generally pissed of with what was said, *like pirate software is*. 

and if you think im supposed to go elsewhere, or i'm suppose to look at some other place, this is literally THEIR webpage with THEIR FAQ.

not including the noes pessary parts here that you need to know is **a fundamental communication failure**.

as thor points out here:
["
if we're going to be putting up these types of ideas specific specifically in front of government we need to be calling out the right issues especially if you don't have precedent set cuz now you're going to be setting precedent on something that doesn't make any sense with people that may not understand the Nuance of our industry all in the name of saving games I can't agree with that
"](
https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=FeZ27_Q1eE1hkDfK&t=176
)

WHICH MAKES COMPLETE SENSE, WHY IS THIS A BAD TAKE?!

![eq voting couincil](https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=675,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/18/1705578989379_20240118_EP-162311D_CU__AH_0020_DOWNLOAD_LARGE-scaled.jpg)

I'M SURE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE KNOWS WHAT A GENSHIT IMPACT IS

thor is also critical of the works sighted, as we can see here:

["
first off I don't like the idea in this that it has a player base of 12 million people that is not how long running games work there is a large number of people that buy the game and that player base slowly dwindles off until nobody is playing anymore if there's any cost associated with keeping the game online which this was an online video game then eventually it costs more to keep it online than it does to keep running it right so the cost outweighs the amount of income for it.
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=wr7FdxCSCFICykQV&t=229)
they then expand on why the servers being shut down makes sense, they use steamDB, a tool which anyone can use to see the active playercount of any steam game.
another creator, a youtuber by the name [zestyjesus](https://www.youtube.com/@ZestyJesus) used it to provide [compelling evidence of tf2's botting issue](https://youtu.be/2stmQfv93oQ?si=SRfCQRqKULIxLlaK&t=681).
and thor uses it pointing out:
["
and if we go to the Cru steamdb which again is not going to be all of the player base for this it's only going to show the ones who were playing it through Steam,
(...)
and it had a major drop off in 2018 which is the same year that it launched a squel
(...)
this is normal.
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=a09D5sGElxYyC5A3&t=364)
so let's quickly check out this claim before we go much further.
if what they said was true, we should be able to see this repeated, so let's choose 3 major games that fit that bill:
first will be call of duty with: black ops 2 (2012), then ghosts(2013), then advanced warfare(2014). and if we look, black ops 2 and ghost follow the exact same pattern. advanceds warfare did take a lot less of a hit, however according to steam it also had around 1/3 the playerbase, and if i recall correctly a lot of people didn't like the jetpack stuff they added and opted out of the game because of that.
 
i could see how you might not agree with advanced warfare, but black ops 2 and ghosts CLEARLY follow that trend.

they then expand on this crew claim with: 
["
so let's take a look at this and find out more about the crew itself if we pull up their Wikipedia we can see that the crew was actually created in 2014 which much to the hatred of all of us oldies on the internet was 10 years ago so this was an online only racing video game
(...)
and included both role playing and large scale multiplayer elements so it had a massive multiplayer component to it it is an online only service-based game and they shut it down 10 years later on March 31st 2024 Ubisoft shut down the game servers rendering the game unplayable which is normal for live service games.
(...)
the only thing that I can see in here that could be a problem is if they posted it as not an online only experience but everything that I found online shows that the game was always marketed as online only 
(..)
if you're going to be buying an online only game that means it can only run when it's online and if the servers need to shut down in the future far in the future it makes sense to me for the access to that game to be cut if it's online only if it's a single player experience that has online only functionality specifically just to shut down the game in the future and the online only doesn't actually add any gameplay functionality I'd agree with you that's a shitty business practice but that's really rare and in the specific cases where it does happen we should call out that not just all games and not all live service games
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=6p8m-gbHgKJrPNLm&t=269)
now i think one thing here that could help thors case here is some form of middle-ground concession, such as saying "maybe some law stating the game must have active servers for one year after the digital storefront was taken down or 2 years after the last physical copy was shipped. whichever comes last."
as i feel like this is a solid middle ground that makes it a lot easier for consumers to buy a game but i digress.

however, they then immediately concede some ground with the following statement:
["
 there are bad business practices that can occur in there there are companies that will sell a online only game as a single player experience and kind of just put it into the TOS and hide it but not all companies do that when they do we should be calling out that specific company not all companies 
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=VcjHGWA3o7SZhip8&t=254).
this is i'm not being cynical simply seems like someone who is concerned about the direction of the industry and this legislation.
i cannot in good faith see any major issues with that statement.

they then later expand on it with:
["

"]()

and i don't like ross's perspective towards this either, if we look at their gamers nexus interview, he says:
["
that's really the best route to go for how these initiatives work is to keep it simple believe me the EU Commission will drill into all the details and figure out what makes sense we're just trying to get our foot in the door on this yeah so so I guess for people watching it
"](https://youtu.be/p9ahH6HrtTc?si=FXt7ImuEg28sfRIm&t=2363)

...
i really don't like this, like, really really don't like this. the reason being is that it pushes a tonne of the burden onto the EU commission to figure out the details, which can work, but is also terrible.

if i approached you right now saying "oh yeh, i got this sick new idea for a game, it's a game where every npc has it's own custom ai and each one will have their own goals and personalities like a person, and it's all in a titanfall world. 
can i have 100,000,000$ to make it happen?"
if i have no experiance making games, expecally of this variety,
**i should be laughed out of the room.** this is the game level of coleslaw where you have people saying "i'll pay you with exposure", and simply saying this feels like a horrible approach to this, because you're then putting the onus on a third party to solve the problem, and with how ross said in the video announding the initiative labeled: 
[Euopeans can save gaming!:
"Politicians like easy wins, and this doesn't require them to do much at all."
](https://youtu.be/mkMe9MxxZiI?si=p-eiGmlfNZxJgYLc&t=207)
now let me ask you, how does pushing all the work onto the eu commission to figure out said laws and points of issues an easy win?
this doesn't sound like a well thought reasoning at all.

they then later expand on it with:
["
If you were an impartial judge just trying to interpret the law, you'd have a headache. I don't know what you would do.
You'd probably tell the EU Commission they need to make a law on this because this is a glaring omission.
So being in the middle of this quagmire right now, if we had rolled up with a million signatures demanding that the EU give us basic consumer rights for video games,
that would have been the easy way out for regulators, because then they would have a mandate. That's what I meant about my half-joke slide about politicians liking easy wins.
"](https://youtu.be/HIfRLujXtUo?si=_heFuH4nAOirjX5h&t=200)
this isn't an easy win tho! this isn't anything close to a win!

as a politician or legislators you're now being told you have more work to do and it's about a subject very few politicians have any experience in.
*now should politicians be expected to do more?*
yes
*has every politician done everything they could to help consumers?*
fuck no lmao
but that doesn't change the fact that this is nothing remotely close to an "easy win", and i would argue completely misuses the term "easy win".

an easy win is when you're playing r6 siege and it's a 5v3 in a ranked game because 2 people left for whatever reason, and the score is now 3-0 in your favor.

not [as politician or legistator] being now forced to look into and to do something.

the only way i could say this is an "easy win" would be for consumers, because then the politicians and legislators now have to assess your case.

but that's not what was said, Ross specifically said IN HIS CORRECTION 
["that would have been an easy win for regulators"](https://youtu.be/HIfRLujXtUo?si=eNh-rxes7gh3xHQS&t=220).
IT'S LITERALLY NOT EASY FOR REGULATORS, IT LITEALLY IS THE OPPOSITE OF AN EASY WIN FOR REGULATORS.

pirate software then also concedes:
["
if it's a single player experience that has online only functionality specifically just to shut down the game in the future and the online only doesn't actually add any gameplay functionality I'd agree with you that's a shitty business practice
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=Td5K-3ncsEIo_F9j&t=336)

### licencing problems
as pirate software also points out:
["
 and we could see that
there was license problems so on
December 14th 2023 Ubisoft delisted the
crew and its expansions from digital
platforms suspended sales of
microtransactions and announced that the
game servers would shut down on March
31st
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=lIkUoqIYltxr2F57&t=399)

and this is a massive issue i don't see anyone acknowledging, and to be feels like everyone who is pro "stop killing games" completely ignores.

there are many many games where assets are streamed in to the player, such as music, models, etc etc.

as [@noodlefunny]() points out on one of the podcasts they co-host with [@samperson](https://www.youtube.com/@SampersonMakes) on 
[@final_V3](https://www.youtube.com/@final_V3):
["
just play out of this car's radio that is dangerous here's the thing it's not
just an MP3 you can include other file types too and the really exciting one
for me is that it supports m3u files and an m3u file is not actually a container
for audio it's a container for instructions it will direct uh the thing trying to play it somewhere where audio
is it's a file path basically it's instructions on where else to go it's a list of files but those those file paths
can be local to your machine or they can be online and the game fully supports
the online part of it so what this means is that the m3u file could direct you to
a an internet radio station or a playlist on your computer equally well.
"](https://youtu.be/7VsT6K5mZ_8?si=gF7t8Nrf-B26tnDx&t=222)

and they later talk about how:

["
that we're going going with and the reason that it costs so much is that it handles licensing oh so we can we can
actually genuinely pick fucking any song we want this isn't going to be like a royaltyfree you know Indie pick like no
this is going to be a real ass radio station you can tune into it and listen to like a very large selection of music
"](https://youtu.be/7VsT6K5mZ_8?si=elQjClg1TvONZyMV&t=847)

so why do i mention this?
*because if a file format exists, there's a large enough install base that will use said file type*.

and with games such as rocket league and forza, and how they have radio stations that are constantly updated, *they're likely dealing with the exact same thing*.

so if you wanted to play a game like say fortnite, the game would need to be stripped of all copy righted music, all likenesses of people (ie snoopdog), maps would need massive amounts of work. things like the avengers events would need to be stripped entirely, or entirely reworked to no longer include the same IP crossovers.

not just that, but let's take other games, have you ever seen this logo when starting up a game?
![bink video logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/Bink_logo.png)

this is the bink video player, and you know what it was used for? *cutscenes*
here's a brief list of some popular games that have used bink:
["
1. farcry 5
1. pokemon scarlet and violet
1. cod WW2
1. assassins creeed oddessy
1. wolfenstien 2
1. southpark: fractured but whole
1. forza motor sport 7
1. overwatch
1. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
1. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy
1. dirt 4
1. prey
1. Ghost recon wildlands
1. doom 2016
1. dark souls 3
1. titan fall 2
1. civs 6
1. deus ex mankind devided
1. and the most signifigant game on the list: "the voice: i want you" for the nintendo wii
"](https://www.giantbomb.com/bink-video/3015-5446/games/)

given THE LEGAL TERMS OF THE LICENSE, THE LICNESE THAT RAD GAME TOOLS POSTS PUBLICALLY:
["
We generally license per game and per platform, but we have other options for unusual licensing situations
"](https://www.radgametools.com/sales.htm)
which is honestly the most shocking and pro user term i've heard, but the issue is that this now also sounds like there's hundreds of contracts, where each studio has unique weird carve outs, and would require rad game tools (the developer of bink) if this were to apply retroactively, they would have to renegotiate 100s of contracts RETROACTIVELY because of a new law being put into place.

going back to fornite, it would effectively be left in a 1.0 shell state, nothing like the current version. with all of the content being stripped from the game, it would be left in a husk state where it would be a shadow at best of its current self.

> "well just renegotiate then!"
thor covers that aswell:
["()
citing upcoming server infrastructure and Licensing constraints what were those licensing constraints well it turns out that all of the cars in the game were licensed from the car companies and a 10 year running game likely means that they had licensed to them for 10 years and that means that it would likely reopen for negotiation Now understand that's speculation but I've seen this type of a deal many times in the industry and while I've been working in it so it's not unlikely if you're going to have to re-negotiate on a game that has so few players and is not turning a profit anymore you're probably just going to forgo the renegotiation and if those servers are aging you're not going to want to recreate that infrastructure and there are some people that'll say well just make it all single player well I've explained that that doesn't make any sense in the first place if you're making it all single player you'd have to carve off all of that and it's developer time and money
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=scZ_mcM9Tc7Nuscn&t=426)

> but i don't care about some studio! i paid money for my game!

["
i don't find that to be a problem
from the developer perspective and I
understand that people find that to be a
problem from the player perspective
these are two different ideologies and
that's okay to have two different
ideologies I just won't agree with it
because I understand the burden that
puts if we raise that problem in the way
that we are right now 
"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=nAi84rIDQAqB_a51&t=475)

and i have to emphasise, this is a reasonable take! as they shared before, and i'll reference, from mid 2020 to march 31st 2024 when the game was shit down, the game had an average of about 50 players, and a max player count of just over 300.

let's quickly do some quick referencing, according to [twine.net:
"
Licensing Costs:
    Production music libraries: $50-500 per track
    Popular music licensing: $500-50,000+ per track
    Perpetual license fees: $1,000-10,000 per track
    Revenue share agreements: 5-15% of game revenue
Original Score Costs:
    Basic package (5-10 tracks): $2,500-7,500
    Standard package (10-20 tracks): $7,500-25,000
    Premium package (20+ tracks): $25,000-100,000+
"](https://www.twine.net/blog/video-game-music-cost-guide/)

so how much would that cost the company, in this case ubisoft for music?
well in this case the game has: around 140 songs,
meaning if we assume the cheapest possible music licensing fee for the game is 70,000$,
using the max player count of 300 player that means that ubisoft would have to spend about 233$ per player to renegotiate just the music licences.

> "i can just play music from youtube! i don't care about the in game music, just give me the game!"

i have many arguements about that but i'll fully concede your point to you, and then swap it over to this:

the crew 1 wiki claims ["here are currently 46 drivable Fullstock cars (including 4 "Street Edition" versions available from preordering the game ...)"](https://thecrew-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Cars)

now the market for this is likely secretive, however from one article i've found has claimed:
["Putting Cars In Video Games Is Now A $2.8 Billion Industry"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/car-in-video-games_n_3793607)

and as thor highlighted:
["
citing upcoming server infrastructure
and Licensing constraints what were
those licensing constraints well it
turns out that all of the cars in the
game were licensed from the car
companies and a 10e running game likely
means that they had licensed to them for
10 years"](https://youtu.be/ioqSvLqB46Y?si=fI_AhjrJH5-QyYuE&t=426)
which means that these companies aren't giving out licences for free.

**so what is the point of all this?**
this means that your game, whatever game you bought, at end of life can *legally no longer distribute the game*
> xqc clip, it's the law

which means your game is going to need be privated )
> ltt  clip privater
in order to be obtained,

and in reguards to the the aswell, there's 2 major issues:
first, the game was market as an mmo, ou can see here, 7 years ago, 6 years before the game was shut down people were complaining about the game not being able to be played offline.

and if you don't like it, you know what, i agree with you, and i think you are right to be hurt, however has the recent gorden ma once said:
["
internet you will disagree you will piss
and moan in the comments all day you
will cry about it scream about it go on
Twitter and Reddit and no and then you
go to buy your Nvidia card.
"](https://youtu.be/AiekGcwaIho?si=-8uYonaqqse2vT0Z&t=1295)

and it's the exact same thing with games. now i understand it sucks to hear that you might be a part of the problem, but remember companies will always chase the dollar, and the simple purpose of companies like EA and activision is to transition money from your wallet to theirs.

let's not forget a ubisoft exec said, and i quote:
["
Gamers Need to Get 'Comfortable' Not Owning Their Games
"](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-exec-says-gamers-need-to-get-comfortable-not-owning-their-games-for-subscriptions-to-take-off)
why do you want to support companies and people who think like that?

so here, instead of pushing the same generic slop let me soap box for a second and recommend some alternatives to some popular games with an "elevator pitch":
- Call of duty: 
    - if you enjoy the zoomer "can't watch a youtube video without subway surfers" gameplay with the crackhead flicks and being a walking arsonol, then give [ultrakill]() a shot. it has amazing levels, some of the best gunplay i've seen in a game. if you're not concerned with multiplayer but what that rush, ultrakill will make you feel like the angle of death. This game has more tech then a chip fab. Once you get skilled enough you can literally do anime esc fights where you're airborne for minutes without even touching the ground. it's campiegn although light on words is fun and each level has a fun gimmic to keep everything fresh and it doesn't feel repetitive at all. still in early access but even if the game stopped development it is so good you should still get it.
    - if you want something multiplayer focused, that feel like older cod but mixed with a bit of tarkov i've heard wonderful things about [the hunt showdow](https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/), however i haven't personally played it so it's a hollow recommendation. however someone i know would be upset if i didn't recommend it.
    - if you want something like zombies, then [7 days to die]() is a great alternative, the movement isn't as great and it is a survival game, however it scratches the itch i have of: find utility, find a place to anchor, set up your defences, survive. and with randomly generated maps and a building system similar to minecraft there is a tonne to do.
    - if you want something more in and out similar to ghosts then you have [deep rock galactic](). you and 4 team mates enter a generated cave system, complete the object without everyone going down, then extract. there's 4 classes with abilities, unlockables, and tech you can find around the caves if you keep an eye out.
    - and if you want a traditional campeign, with cinematic momements, there's things like [fallout:new vegas](), prey, [doom2016](), the [main 3 halo games](), and some others.
    - battle-field: i actually have 2 for this, if you prefer the more team based "everyones a pawn" approach there's [battle-bit remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/) however the devs have fallen behind on their updates with little communication so maybe not the best idea, or if you enjoy a more "hero shooter" esc playstyle, then [Wild Assult]()
- apex legends: 
- titanfall: IN ULTRAKILL YOU CAN RIDE ROCKETS WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT-

### people need to listen to experts:
giving gamers what they want:
- sonic fronteirs (open world sonic)
- halo infinate (open world halo)
- listening to pro players (gamers not devs, tf2, r6 siege, overwatch)
