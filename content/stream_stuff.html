				<li>keep vibes good: we're all here for fun! lots of people have stressful lives and whatnot, so let's
					not contribute to that :3</li>
				<li>no spoiliers: i understand you really wanna talk about it but unless i've said otherwise please no!</li>
				<li>no instructing (aka backseating): this is my [vulbyte's] personal playthrough, i'm fine making mistakes so
					let's just see where the journey takes us :3</li>
				<li>the only person you're allowed to harass is vulbyte! don't harass other users in chat</li>

			<summary>for mods</summary>
			<p>this is meant to be a sorta general guide for mods to follow, if something isn't clear use your best judgement,
				if i [vulbyte] have an issue with it i'll just dm you about it later :3
			</p>
			<div>
				<aside>if you do make a judgement i just want you to be able to answer these questions:
				</aside>

				<ul>
					<li>who did you ban?</li>
					<li>what were they doing?</li>
					<li>when did they do it?</li>
					<li>why did you think this was appropriate action?</li>
					<li>how many times did they do it?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>outside that, here are some guidelines for you, and how you should generally respond:</p>
