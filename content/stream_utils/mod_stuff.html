		<ul>
			<li>Be Fair & Consistent: Apply rules equally to everyone. No favorites.</li>
			<li>Enforce the Rules: Immediately address spam, hate speech, threats, and harassment.</li>
			<li>Use the 3-Strike System (Suggested): Use a brief Warning/Timeout for minor offenses, a Longer Timeout for
				repeat offenses, and a Ban for persistent rule-breaking or severe harassment.</li>
			<li>Keep the Vibe Positive: Encourage good discussion and fun. Remove negativity that derails the chat.</li>
			<li>Don't Argue: Do not engage in back-and-forth arguments with trolls or rule-breakers. Action, then move on.
			</li>
			<li>Mute Backseat Gaming: Remove unsolicited "spoilers" or commands unless the streamer explicitly asks for help.
			</li>
			<li>Trust Your Team: When in doubt about a ban, confer privately with other mods or the streamer.</li>
			<li>Know When to DM: If a situation is complex, message the streamer or the mod group privately. Do not debate mod
				actions in public chat.</li>
		</ul>
