				"artists and authors who have had their data, works, and products should be compensated".
				<br><br>
				please review the following for statements on AI and types of ai. <em>most is negative</em><br>
				All direct uses of generative AI such as: chatGPT, midjourney, and the like will be claimed (please note i am
				human, and may make mistakes, or not recognize it in some cases -vulbyte)
				<details>
					<summary>audio generation</summary>
					i do not believe there is a place for AI. artists and authors who have had their data, works, and products
					should be compensated.
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>text generation</summary>
					artists and authors who have had their data, works, and products should be compensated. <br>
					i believe text generation is useful as an alternative to google and code help, so i will commonly receive help
					from them for small things like correcting a code snippit
					in that way from them. <br>
					however i do not believe in using chatGPT or any other generative text model as a source or a place to get an
					informed opinion from. <br>
					Uses of these sources will not be claimed as they're not used directly, nor will they be used directly in any
					scripts, blogs, statements, or things of that nature. To do otherwise would be a failure to the community and
					audience.
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>image generation</summary>
					i do not believe there is a place for AI. artists and authors who have had their data, works, and products
					should be compensated.
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>video generation</summary>
					i do not believe there is a place for AI. artists and authors who have had their data, works, and products
					should be compensated.
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>other (machine vision and things of the like)</summary>
					these versions are more ethical in my opinion as they do not offer replacements for the original works, thus
					ethically i am content using them.
