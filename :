			hello! i'm vulbyte and this is my ranking of games! <br>
			i just wanted to add a little micro blerb about how this works before you read, because <em>my ranking is
				not-conventional.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			so here's how it works, is this graph is 2d, the higher on the list it is the better of a game i think it is
			overall.
			<br>
			then the ranking i give a game out of 10 is how well i think the game aligns with the perceived vision and overall
			fun of the game.
			<br>
			so as an example, a 6/10 game which is boring but is genuinely revolutionary might be very very high on the list,
			while a 9/10 game which is really fun might [very unlikely] be below it.
			<br>
			please also not the graphics meet a similar bar, so as an example a low poly game that flawlessly executes the
			poly poly style they're going for will have a better graphics rating when a realistic game where there's a very
			visible texture seam on the guns you hold
			<br>
			this is all obviously arbitrary so don't read into it too much :3

								it uses graphics best described as "late ps1" but with some modern improves. although seen as a downside
								it helps the game run at consistent stable framerates. <br>
