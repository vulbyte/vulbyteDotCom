	<h2>Prelude</h2>
	<pre>
		we understand legal stuff can be annoying to read, so what we've done is added little sections to help you decipher
		the meaning.
		<em>
			They are not a part of the terms and any meaning meaning/conflicts are not to override the Terms of Service
			(TOS).<br>
			They are a simplification that might leave out nuance or important details.<br>
			If unsure please seek legal council.
		</em>
		<u>They are simply there to help understand in a more simplified way at a glance for sections you may wish to read
			more carefully, and/or give insight to why we are collecting this information.</u>
		you can tell these sections apart because they will look like below:
		<details>
			<summary>simplified</summary>
			here's an example of the simplified version

		<details>
			<summary>why</summary>
			here's an example of the reasoning for why we're doing this

		<details>
			<summary>why</summary>
			For security purposes, we monitor login attempts and may require verification for unrecognized access patterns.

			Similarly with your device, if you use a specific iphone as an example, then there's a new attempt from an android
			that is an odd change that should trigger re-verification for your sake.
			The other reason is for user experience. We track performance, so if we notice an odd "hotspot", we want to know
			if it's potentially a hardware issue, and if not then we know what to investigate!
